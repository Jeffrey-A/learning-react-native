Lists

- ScrollView -> good for rendering short list

- FlatList --> very usefull for generating a long list, 
it allows to only render the first items and show the rest as you scroll.

It only updates when its props are changed.


- SectionList -> Same as FlatList but it has additional support for sections.

Each section has it's own array

I also need to pass a section header renderer

User Input

- TextInput

They recomend to use controlled components (provide onChance events to update the value)
